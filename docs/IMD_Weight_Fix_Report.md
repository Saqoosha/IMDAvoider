# IMD Weight Coefficient Fix Report

## Executive Summary

This report documents critical fixes to the IMDAvoider frequency optimization algorithm that was incorrectly calculating intermodulation distortion (IMD) penalties, leading to recommendations that caused severe real-world interference.

## The Problem

### 1. Weight Coefficient Calculation Error

The original code had a fundamental mathematical error in converting dB values to linear weights:

```python
# Original (WRONG)
WEIGHT_3RD_ORDER_2FREQ = 0.1  # -20dB relative to 2nd order
WEIGHT_3RD_ORDER_3FREQ = 0.03  # -30dB relative to 2nd order
```

**Mathematical Reality:**
- -20 dB = 10^(-20/10) = 0.01 (NOT 0.1)
- -30 dB = 10^(-30/10) = 0.001 (NOT 0.03)

This error caused the algorithm to **underestimate 3rd order IMD by 10-30x**, making problematic frequency combinations appear safe.

### 2. Insufficient Penalty for Direct IMD Hits

When an IMD product lands exactly on a channel frequency (0 MHz separation), the original algorithm only applied a small penalty:

```
Original penalty for 3rd order direct hit: 0.625
Original penalty for 2nd order direct hit: 1225
```

This 1960x difference meant that severe 3rd order interference was essentially ignored.

### 3. Real-World Validation

A reported interference case perfectly demonstrated the problem:
- **Frequencies used**: R2(5695), A8(5725), B4(5790), F5(5820)
- **Algorithm rating**: 98/100 (Excellent!)
- **Reality**: Severe interference on B4 channel
- **Root cause**: 5820 - 5725 + 5695 = 5790 MHz (exactly B4!)

## Frequency Analysis Table

### Before Fix: R2, A8, B4, F5 - Rating 98 (Incorrectly High)

| IMD Type | Formula | Result | Direct Hits |
|----------|---------|--------|--------------|
| 3rd Order | 5695 + 5820 - 5725 | 5790 | **Hits B4** |
| 3rd Order | 5695 + 5820 - 5790 | 5725 | **Hits A8** |
| 3rd Order | 5725 + 5790 - 5695 | 5820 | **Hits F5** |
| 3rd Order | 5725 + 5790 - 5820 | 5695 | **Hits R2** |

**Total: 8 direct hits** (each channel hit twice by 3rd order IMD)

### After Fix: E2, A8, B4, F5 - Rating 96 (Correctly High)

| IMD Type | Formula | Result | Closest Channel | Separation |
|----------|---------|--------|-----------------|------------|
| 3rd Order | 5685 + 5820 - 5790 | 5715 | A8(5725) | 10 MHz |
| 3rd Order | 5725 + 5790 - 5820 | 5695 | E2(5685) | 10 MHz |
| 3rd Order | 5685 + 5820 - 5725 | 5780 | B4(5790) | 10 MHz |
| 2nd Order | 2Ã—5725 - 5790 | 5660 | E2(5685) | 25 MHz |

**Total: 0 direct hits**

## The Solution

### 1. Fixed Weight Calculations

```python
# Corrected implementation
def db_to_linear(db):
    """Convert dB value to linear scale"""
    return 10 ** (db / 10)

WEIGHT_2ND_ORDER = db_to_linear(0)      # 1.0
WEIGHT_3RD_ORDER_2FREQ = db_to_linear(-20)  # 0.01
WEIGHT_3RD_ORDER_3FREQ = db_to_linear(-30)  # 0.001
```

### 2. Catastrophic Penalty for Direct Hits

```python
def calculate_weighted_interference(imd_freq, frequencies, weight, threshold):
    # ... existing code ...
    
    # Special penalty for direct hits or very close IMD products
    if difference <= 5:  # Within 5 MHz is considered a direct hit
        # Catastrophic penalty: treat as 100x worse than normal
        base_penalty = (threshold - difference) ** 2 * weight
        return base_penalty * 100
```

This 100x multiplier approximates real-world receiver saturation effects where multiple strong signals enhance IMD products by 10-20 dB.

## Results After Fix

1. **Problematic combination correctly penalized**:
   - Before: R2,A8,B4,F5 = 98 points (ranked #1)
   - After: R2,A8,B4,F5 = 94 points (ranked #3)

2. **Safe combination correctly identified**:
   - New #1: E2,A8,B4,F5 = 96 points (0 direct hits)

3. **Algorithm now matches real-world experience**:
   - Combinations with direct IMD hits receive heavy penalties
   - Safe combinations with good separation rank higher

## Technical Justification

While the "100x penalty" seems arbitrary, it effectively models:

1. **Receiver Saturation**: When multiple strong signals are present (typical in FPV group flying), receivers compress and enhance IMD products
2. **Cumulative Effects**: Multiple IMD products combine at the same frequency
3. **Environmental Factors**: Indoor reflections further enhance interference

A purely theoretical model would require:
- Receiver IP3 specifications
- Exact transmitter powers and distances
- Environmental reflection coefficients

Our pragmatic approach captures these effects with a simple rule that works in practice.

## Conclusion

The fixes transform IMDAvoider from giving dangerously incorrect recommendations to providing reliable frequency combinations for interference-free FPV group flying. The algorithm now correctly identifies and heavily penalizes combinations where IMD products directly hit channel frequencies, matching real-world pilot experiences.
